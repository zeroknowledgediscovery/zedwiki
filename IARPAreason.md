# Target

> Analysts sort through huge amounts of often uncertain and conflicting information as they strive to answer intelligence questions. REASON will facilitate analystsâ€™ work by pointing them to key pieces of evidence beyond what they have already considered and helping them determine which alternative explanation has the strongest support. It will do this automatically and on demand as the analyst works on a problem. The program will exploit recent advances in artificial intelligence not to do the analysis but to help analysts do it even better. As a result, policymakers all the way up to the President will receive analytic reports with the highest accuracy, clarity and timeliness. REASON will help intelligence analysts solve national security puzzles by identifying crucial overlooked pieces of information and showing ways they fit together. REASON aims to develop novel systems that automatically generate comments enabling intelligence analysts to substantially improve the evidence and reasoning in their analytic reports.

# Plan

REASON will help intelligence analysts solve national security puzzles by identifying crucial overlooked pieces of information and showing ways they fit together.

+ Predicting terror events
    - how predictable (is it stochastic?)
    - Is it predictable?
    - What variables are important?

+ Assess threat levels
    - reconstruct missing information
    - reconstruct partially observable world views

+ Predict risk of future events
    - draw future event sequences
    - quantify unceratinty estimates in causal reports or narratives
    - identify evidencary support for narratives

# Core Capabilities

+ fractal net : time sequence of events
+ gibbs net: spatial structure and evolution, including beliefs, variable alignment, under missing data
    - what beliefs do an individual actually hold?
    - will an individual take action A, B or C? what are teh probabilities?
    - Predicting organizational actions in terror groups or crime families or hate groups.
