## comments

SOA:

+ very nicely layout platforms developed
+ used to predictive processes
+ biomedical and sociolofgical applications
+ welldone

But:


+ some aspect of why these pltforms why these platforms are superior? What are they?
+ Not that many people will read this statement will apreciate
+ try to explain what are teh advances in methodology that you have made
+ makes it possible to use these things

----

ZCoR: messy data, that could?
Qnet: rare events from high lvel complex datasets

-----

+ Try to say more so overview WHAT THEY ALLOW YOU TO DO
+ 
==> prefatory page is good/ excellant
==> messy data into the prefatory... you have done a little bit. But do more.

==> Focus on individual papers too much.. instead of working through individual papers, give a narrative. Spend a third to half of a page explaininbg how ZCoR works and how it works. Shopuld not feel like magic.

-----

+ prefatory: focus on philosophy and waht you see what are the big problems as you see it. 
+ Key contribution was a bit of redundant
+ Age of AI can probably be shortened
+ WHAT YOUR BIG QUESTIONS ARE


give why how

+ Peer-reviewed:
    - narrative form is better.
    - should the paper pargraphs be there? Right now a bit too long and too detailed
    - I want to know what zcoir is, what is the the philosophy
    --- 4 : past data, geographical data sets. Tell me why and how.
    --- 5 : stochastic data generotors... philosophy of fractal net.


+ Length is fine.
+ Add philosophy in 
+ 3 pages / 2 pages 
+ How much money do you need... slip in that in the statement. We are fully supported, we wish to expand.

# letter writers
---

+ If you bias their list too heavily, then it woudl appear you are hand-picking your reviewers
+ resources

# education
