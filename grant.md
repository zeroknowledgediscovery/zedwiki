# NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine

    As this data resource gains maturity, analyses that effectively synthesize very large volumes of information from across many different datatypes remain scarce. NHLBI seeks to fund analyses and development of tools that utilize existing TOPMed omics data to uncover the molecular mechanisms driving HLBS disease. Investigators are encouraged to utilize a systems approach incorporating computational modeling to bring together high throughput genotype and phenotype datasets. Analyses may incorporate new or existing data generated outside of TOPMed. However, this Notice seeks studies that will use existing TOPMed data as the major resource for analyses of HLBS diseases and measures. TOPMed has particular interest in questions about identifying associations between variants and disease phenotypes, and in analyses using existing functional data to reveal associations and/or make functional inferences. Investigators are encouraged to use the ancestry diversity of TOPMed for discovery and not merely for replication of findings in a single ancestry group.

# RDT

Amount: > 6M total costs, ie about 4M direct costs
Our goal is that the new RDT will help stimulate more science at the interface of different disciplines and transcend traditional departmental boundaries. Iâ€™m excited to be committing resources to support more far-reaching research proposals and to help increase our visibility and position as scientific leaders. If you have questions about the implementation of the RDT or have an upcoming proposal deadline that may qualify for RDT services, please contact Connie Lee at `cmlee@bsd.uchicago.edu`. Our hope is that team will be fully staffed by later this spring.
