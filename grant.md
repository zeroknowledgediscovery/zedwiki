# Child development fund - Diet and/or Microbiome

http://www.waterloofoundation.org.uk/ChildDevelopmentResearchDeadlines.html

£65,000GBP (81,843.289 US Dollars)

The Waterloo Foundation invites applications for its child development fund - diet and the microbiome and ADHD. This supports research projects on diet or the microbiome in child development as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). For diet and the microbiomey, studies focusing on the following are particularly welcomed:
•microbiome and Neurodevelopment in children;
•the impacts of breastmilk on infant microbiome and brain: particularly early gut development in premature infants;
•ADHD and the gut;
•the impacts of micronutrients and fatty acids during Pregnancy and the effect on infant gut or neurodevelopment ADHD.

# PCORI

May 2

High prpensity: people who recive care here
Can we expand this cohort to high propensity cohort beyond who is going to recive care here

+ WHo will get back to care here in UCM 
+ univariate , standard ML , standard mulrivariate cohorts
+ Aim1
    - read if this is a good description of ML standard methods
    - Add a comparator for more advanced methods
    - Dont delete text in bold
    - if you feel that it is wrong on redundant or something like that, correcting it or editing


The application lacks details with regards to the machine learning (ML) methods that will be used to
estimate propensity scores in Aim 1. 

A suite of ML methods will be used and the best model will be chosen
based on the weighted F1 metric using nested K-fold cross-validation on the training data. Given the sample
size (=2,000) and the fact that ML methods are typically data greedy, this could be problematic and could
potentially yield biased estimates of model accuracy. 

Feature selection method for the longitudinal and
temporal variables is also not described. (Moderate)

It is also not clear if and how the ''best model'' will be validated on an external data to obtain honestestimates of the model accuracy. (Minor)  **out of sample performance evaluation**

Potential for algorithm bias across EHRs and contingency plans not discussed. (Minor)

Aims 1 and 2 will use already existing PCOR/CER methods. No further development or refinement ofthese methods are planned. (Moderate)

It is also not clear whether the research can produce a generalized framework that works uniformlybest across diverse EHRs. Therefore, the study may have limited impact on informing best practices orstandards for PCOR/CER. (Moderate)


The size of study population may not be adequate for nonparametric estimates such as random forestproposed in Aim 1 (moderate). ** add estimated figure**

The investigators plan to use multiple imputation as one of their methods for Aim 2, which on its ownis insufficient for data that are missing not at random (MNAR) (moderate)

We have only modest detail of how vanderbilt and oncology populations will be used as validationsets (minor).

    As this data resource gains maturity, analyses that effectively synthesize very large volumes of information from across many different datatypes remain scarce. NHLBI seeks to fund analyses and development of tools that utilize existing TOPMed omics data to uncover the molecular mechanisms driving HLBS disease. Investigators are encouraged to utilize a systems approach incorporating computational modeling to bring together high throughput genotype and phenotype datasets. Analyses may incorporate new or existing data generated outside of TOPMed. However, this Notice seeks studies that will use existing TOPMed data as the major resource for analyses of HLBS diseases and measures. TOPMed has particular interest in questions about identifying associations between variants and disease phenotypes, and in analyses using existing functional data to reveal associations and/or make functional inferences. Investigators are encouraged to use the ancestry diversity of TOPMed for discovery and not merely for replication of findings in a single ancestry group.

# RDT

Amount: > 6M total costs, ie about 4M direct costs
Our goal is that the new RDT will help stimulate more science at the interface of different disciplines and transcend traditional departmental boundaries. I’m excited to be committing resources to support more far-reaching research proposals and to help increase our visibility and position as scientific leaders. If you have questions about the implementation of the RDT or have an upcoming proposal deadline that may qualify for RDT services, please contact Connie Lee at `cmlee@bsd.uchicago.edu`. Our hope is that team will be fully staffed by later this spring.
