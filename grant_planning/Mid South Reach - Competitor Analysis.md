* Merative ([Predictive AI solutions focus on imaging](https://www.merative.com/content/dam/merative/documents/ebook/achieving-the-benefits-of-ai.pdf))
* Epic's Cognitive Computing Suite ([Focusing on population health insights, automatization of medical coding](https://www.epic.com/software/ai/))
* Google Health

Epic’s “Cognitive Computing” suite, and Cerner's "Predictive Analytics,". 


These platforms, while widely used, often focus on common diseases and do not specialize in co-occurring disease patterns or ultra-rare conditions.

The ZCoR platform differentiates itself by targeting ultra-rare diseases through the use of risk-balanced datasets and zero-burden comorbidity scoring, a unique methodology that ensures the identification of high-risk patients without requiring additional testing or invasive procedures. ZCoR can integrate seamlessly with existing EHR systems, giving it a significant market edge by leveraging the data already collected in clinical settings.
