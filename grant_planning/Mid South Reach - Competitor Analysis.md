> ## Describe the market for this product and include an analysis of competitors/competitor products (both currently available and those in development)

The healthcare analytics market, specifically predictive analytics, is expected to reach over $30 billion by 2027. 

Key competitors in this space include large-scale EHR systems with embedded analytics tools such as Merative (formerly IBM Watson Health), Google Health, Oracle's Cerner and Epicâ€™s Cognitive Computing suite. 

These platforms, while offering a wide variety of EHR-powered solutions, share two key limitations in utilizing EHR data we aim to address:

1. Most state-of-the-art predictive AI solutions rely on imaging data ([Merative](https://www.merative.com/content/dam/merative/documents/ebook/achieving-the-benefits-of-ai.pdf), [PathAI](https://www.pathai.com/), [Tempus](https://www.tempus.com/radiology/), [Google Health](https://health.google/health-research/imaging-and-diagnostics/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-for-health/)), neglecting the insights that can be found in the data sources that are collected universally in clinical setting and limiting the scope of targettable problems to those with established practice of imaging. 
2. Models that rely on EHR tend to focuswith focus on EHR analysis tend to focus on common diseases and complications (such as [early detection of sepsis in hospital environment](https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/2024/05/02/using-ai-to-predict-the-onset-of-sepsis)) and do not specialize in co-occurring disease patterns or ultra-rare conditions.

There are multiple AI models in development that use EHR data for early prediction of rare diseases, including:

* [Alzheimer's Disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00573-8#MOESM3)
* [Renal Faliure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214579621000514#fg0050) 
* [Heart Failure](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0260885) 
* [Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease](https://peerj.com/articles/16950/) 
* [Melanoma](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.26.24311080v1)


However, these models tend to rely on a limited set of EHR-derived features that are already known to have a connection to the risk of disease onset, and often require laboratory tests to achieve optimal predictive performance.

The ZCoR platform differentiates itself by targeting ultra-rare diseases through the use of risk-balanced datasets and zero-burden comorbidity scoring, a unique methodology that ensures the identification of high-risk patients without requiring additional testing or invasive procedures. ZCoR can integrate seamlessly with existing EHR systems, giving it a significant market edge by leveraging the data already collected in clinical settings.
