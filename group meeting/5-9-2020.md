@Dmytro:

+ Ready mag page MUST be accessible at all times with table of current performances. Each applicationb must include current AUC, baseline AUC, n-total, Prediction window, inference window, precursor phenotypes, target phenotypes
+ Formalize the parameters of the general model. The objective here is to describe the xCOR model as a tuple: 
$$  M(I,P,C,\rho_h,\tau_h): \mathcal{D} \rightarrow [0,1]  $$
where \\\( I,P,C\\\) are the inference, prediction and confidence windows, \\\( \mathcal{D}\\\) is the dataset, and the mapping is the risk calculation. Lets identify if our applications conform to thsi model, extend it if necessary (in an elegant manner), and maintain a table with all the parameters. **This is the basis of the general xCor paper**
