# What is a digital twin

Not really like "old" digital twins, we may want exact replication of behavior of teh system, or a stochastic replication: systems can be science models, or people. Applications are in:

+ new science, complex systems
+ social modeling?
+ polarization of society
+ game play
+ science of science
    - authors of a particulaer paper, roleplay, and brainstorm
    - generate reserach outcomes
    - do they generate more novels
+ predicting future human interactions

# Why make a digital twin?

+ solve unsolved problems in science 
+ make humans better (coaching)?

# Population and individual DT models

We can have piopulation and individual models, and can taje different ideas.

# how to evaluate digital twins
+ simulate the real world, and have some metrics of computing simialrity
+ predictatbility of population vs local level
+ align large language models

# The "green" bar
  
Can DT make us achieve the green bar? By making better coaches for humans.
  
# Current LLM has over-alignemnt with User Prompt/Expectation

LLMs are bad, too predictable.

# Do we need to give up something?

Human knowledge is limited. And this makes us distinctuve, maybe LLMs are "bad" because it knows too much

# Ethical Question of Digital Twin

Can we make DT of people, and release in the wild, or do we need regulatory oversight.
