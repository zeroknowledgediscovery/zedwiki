# Cell structure

Title, authors, affiliations, author list footnotes, corresponding author(s) e-mail address(es), summary, introduction, results, discussion, acknowledgments, author contributions, declaration of interests, figure titles and legends, tables with titles and legends, STAR Methods, supplemental information titles and legends, and references. The text (title through references) should be provided as one document. Figures, supplemental information, and the key resources table should be provided separately.

## Cover letter

What was previously known (background), the conceptual advance pr###ovided by your work (contributions), and the significance to a broad readership (impact). This is one of the few chances to "sell" your work to the editor—why is this article a good fit for Cell Reports Medicine? What is the work's relevance to society in the context of environmental change and/or sustainability? Try to avoid repeating segments from the abstract and/or conclusions. Please indicate all contributing authors and their affiliations. You may also suggest appropriate reviewers or referees and make up to three requests for reviewer or referee exclusions. Please use the cover letter to notify us of information that is relevant to our handling and evaluation of your paper (e.g., related work, time constraints, competition).


# Cell STAR Methods
The STAR Methods section should be included in the same Word document as the main text. The section
should be introduced after the figure legends.

## STAR sections

+ Resource availability (required), 
+ experimental model and subject details (when appropriate), 
+ method details (required), 
+ quantification and statistical analysis (when appropriate), and 
+ additional resources (when appropriate). 

> How do I report the availability of the code, and data presented in my paper?
> Cell Press requires two formal statements about the resources that may be requested from the lead contact after publication. These statements comprise the resource availability section of the STAR Methods. They are:

*The materials availability statement.*
 This statement pertains to new reagents. It needs to be made even if your paper doesn’t generate new reagents. You can learn more about it here.

*The data and code availability statement.*
 This statement pertains to all data and original code (including scripts) reported in the paper. It needs to be made even if your paper doesn’t generate new data, original code, or use scripts. You can learn more about it here.

**Do I need to include a key resource table in the STAR Methods?**
> The key resources table is required for manuscripts with an experimental component. If a purely computational manuscript links to any external datasets (previously published or new), code-containing websites (e.g. a GitHub repo), or uses non-standard software, it needs to include a key resources table that details these aspects of the paper. Purely computational or theoretical papers that don’t contain any external links and use standard software don’t require a key resources table, although you’re welcome to include one if you like.

**Where should I report my mathematical analysis, modeling details, proofs, lemmas, etc.?**
> All mathematical analysis, modeling details, proofs, lemmas, etc. need to be included in the *STAR Methods*, which is in the main text. We require this on principle: these things are critically important and function as methods with respect to gleaning scientific insight. We treat them accordingly.


## RESOURCE AVAILABILITY

###  lead contact

Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be
fulfilled by the lead contact, Jane Doe (janedoe@qwerty.com).

####  materials availability

This study did not generate new unique reagents.

####  data and code availability

• All original code has been deposited at Zenodo and is publicly available as of the date of
publication. DOIs are listed in the key resources table.

• Any additional information required to reanalyze the data reported in this paper is available
from the lead contact upon request.


#### Instructions for section 1: Data

• [De-identified human/patient standardized datatype] data have been deposited at [datatypespecific repository], and accession numbers are listed in the key resources table. They are available upon request until [date or delete “until”] if access is granted. To request access, contact [insert name of governing body and instructions for requesting access]. [Insert the
following when applicable] In addition, [summary statistics describing these data/processed
datasets derived from these data] have been deposited at [datatype-specific repository] and are
publicly available as of the date of publication. These accession numbers are also listed in the
key resources table.




• The [adjective] data reported in this study cannot be deposited in a public repository because
[reason]. To request access, contact [insert name of governing body and instructions for
requesting access]. [Insert the following when applicable] In addition, [summary statistics
describing these data/processed datasets derived from these data] have been deposited at
[datatype-specific or general-purpose repository] and are publicly available as of the date of
publication. [Accession numbers or DOIs] are listed in the key resources table.

• This paper analyzes existing, publicly available data. These accession numbers for the
datasets are listed in the key resources table.

• [Adjective or all] data reported in this paper will be shared by the lead contact upon request.

#### Instructions for section 2: Code

• All original code has been deposited at [repository] and is publicly available as of the date of
publication. DOIs are listed in the key resources table.

• All original code is available in this paper’s supplemental information.

• This paper does not report original code.

#### Instructions for section 3:

Any additional information required to reanalyze the data
reported in this paper is available from the lead contact upon request.

## METHOD DETAILS

All datasets, program code, and methods used in your manuscript must be appropriately cited in the text
and listed in the references section, either in the form of the publications in which they were first reported
or in the form of independent persistent identifiers such as the DOI.

## QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Statistical tests used, exact value of n, what n represents (e.g., number of
animals, number of devices, number of cells, number of times a chemical reaction was run, etc.),
definition of center, and dispersion and precision measures (e.g., mean, median, SD, SEM, confidence
intervals). Also please summarize in this section how significance was defined, the statistical methods
used to determine strategies for randomization and/or stratification, sample size estimation, and inclusion
and exclusion of any data or subjects, as well as any methods used to determine whether the data met
assumptions of the statistical approach.

## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES 

Omit unless clinical trial, or some other website membership

## KEY RESOURCES TABLE

The key resources table serves to highlight materials and resources (including starting materials needed
for synthesis, genetically modified organisms and strains, cell lines, reagents, software, experimental
models, and original source data for computational studies) essential to reproduce results presented in
the manuscript. The items in the table must also be reported alongside the description of their use in the
method details section. Literature cited within the key resources table must be included in the references
list. We highly recommend using RRIDs (see https://scicrunch.org/resources) as the identifier for
antibodies and model organisms in the key resources table.
