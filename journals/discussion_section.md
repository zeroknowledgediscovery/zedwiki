# Writing The Discussion Section

First make sure your study follows the [STROBE checklist](https://www.strobe-statement.org/checklists/) for cohort studies.

First start with answering the research question (**that you put at the end of your introduction**) briefly, with a summary of the most important findings.

Then go to discussing each finding separately, starting with the most important and moving to the least. 

In each finding, compare with previous research, focus on similarities, and suggest hypothesis for differences. do NOT neglect conflicting findings from previous research. 

You can mention your opinion in findings but this must be clear that it is only an opinion.

Then mention the limitations of the study.

Then write a short conclusion summarizing the answer to the question, with a short take home message, and suggestions for further research.

Avoid these common mistakes:
- Do NOT repeat the results section in the discussion.. Results section is for mentioning numbers, discussion is for interpreting them.
- Do not include general information in the discussion. Its place is in the introduction.
- Do not write paragraphs that may be relevant to the topic itself, but irrelevant to your question.
- Do not make conclusions that your results do not support.
- Do not give strong conclusive statements unless based on solid facts. Otherwise, everything is a hypothesis, and may be true or may not..
That's everything I can think of now... Of course this is just a summary.
