It seems people want to not critique.
Mathematical biology needs validation.

+ INVOLVEMENT OF UNDERGRADS
+ WHERE WORK IS GOING TO BE SHARED



Highly compettitive proposal: 1) MATH, 2) BIOLOGY, 3) INTEGRATION, 4) VALIDATION, 5) BROADER IMPACTS

# Reviews

## broader impacts

+ scientific literacy, wonen , education, minorities
+ economic status improvemnt of US

## additional criteria?

+ solicitation
+ DCL
+ home at NSF

## Who Reviews and How


# how to write competitive proposal

+ READ solicitation (additional requirements)
+ Webinars
+ send most creative idea
+ identify transformative potential and impact, change the paradigm
+ logical, well organized, well illustrated, easily readable (figures must be readable)
+ maybe prepare data management paln, post doc mentoring and grad student mentoring plan.
+ Intellectual Merit
    - thorough well referenced background
    - place proposal clearly in the context (stota, unsolved questions)
    - convincin description of proposed research (hypothesis, preliminary results, approach)
    - bottle necks or deadends and offer alternatives (what if its a method we are proposing?)
    - demonstrate expertise and capabilities (include standard letters confirming collaboration hwre necessarry)
    - formulate compelling conclusions (what will change in teh field if you suceed)
    - lastly write the project summary highlighting teh advances you plan to make
+ Broader Impacts
    - what does NSF mean? 
    - consider what your project contributes inherently (integration of research with education, diversity ehancement, broader scientoifc ans social impacts, technological relevance)
    - additional focused broader activities, outreach, broadening participation, of underpresented groups, reserach experiences of undergraduates or teachers
    - do not present a laundry list, choose judicioulsy ans develop broader aspects in depth
    - demonstrate commitment, and depth
    - 1 to 2 pages
+ submit to the appropriate division and program
    - do nsf awardsearch, use advanced search with key words www.nsf.gov/awardsearch
    - talk to program officers
    - **suggest reviewers** 
    - revise based on panel reviews
