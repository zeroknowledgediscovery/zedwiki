# Comments

+ It seems people want to not critique.
+ Mathematical biology needs validation.

Highly compettitive proposal: 

1. MATH
2. BIOLOGY
3. INTEGRATION
4. VALIDATION
5. BROADER IMPACTS

# Reviews

## Broader impacts

+ scientific literacy, wonen , education, minorities
+ economic status improvemnt of US

## Additional criteria?

+ solicitation
+ DCL
+ home at NSF

# How to write competitive proposal
+ READ solicitation (additional requirements)
+ Webinars
+ send most creative idea
+ identify transformative potential and impact, change the paradigm
+ logical, well organized, well illustrated, easily readable (figures must be readable)
+ maybe prepare data management paln, post doc mentoring and grad student mentoring plan.
+ Intellectual Merit
    - thorough well referenced background
    - place proposal clearly in the context (stota, unsolved questions)
    - convincin description of proposed research (hypothesis, preliminary results, approach)
    - bottle necks or deadends and offer alternatives (what if its a method we are proposing?)
    - demonstrate expertise and capabilities (include standard letters confirming collaboration hwre necessarry)
    - formulate compelling conclusions (what will change in teh field if you suceed)
    - lastly write the project summary highlighting teh advances you plan to make
+ Broader Impacts
    - what does NSF mean? 
    - consider what your project contributes inherently (integration of research with education, diversity ehancement, broader scientoifc ans social impacts, technological relevance)
    - additional focused broader activities, outreach, broadening participation, of underpresented groups, reserach experiences of undergraduates or teachers
    - do not present a laundry list, choose judicioulsy ans develop broader aspects in depth
    - demonstrate commitment, and depth
    - working with undergraduates
    - 1 to 2 pages, and add budget justification
    - xxxx
    - original and creative, not ncessarily of the instituition
    - research acitvities, or even complementary to research
    - inclusion, engagement, STEM education, societal well-being, 
    - name journals where papers will be published
+ submit to the appropriate division and program
    - do nsf awardsearch, use advanced search with key words www.nsf.gov/awardsearch
    - talk to program officers
    - **suggest reviewers** 
    - revise based on panel reviews

# REU 
what is this? apparently this program must exist in the first place

# Salary Support
Submit a letter that you need to bring in salary support.

Is seeking a devlop algorithm neroimaging data to classify patients. ENIGMA
Innovation: good

Inntellectual Merit: 
Combination of TDA and ?. Linking might be missing.

streangths: application of TDA is innovative. There is a datasite, levergiung data.
large datasize, global

weakness: missing link "how to apply TDA to real problem". hetergenous data, demographic variability.
How will TDA be used to analyze this data.
Previous work not mentioned.

Educational impact: 
Diagnosis and treatment for public health. camn improve quality of health. 

Weakness: no specific plan
More specific plan for health policy will be useful

+ Mathematical innovation: maybe, can be better
+ Biological innovation: yes
+ Integation: yes
