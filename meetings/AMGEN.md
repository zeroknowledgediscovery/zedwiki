# ASTA

population data --> deCODE project

ASTHMA drug
+ Cys273Tyr pvalue e-13
+ Large data sources and genomics

# Ian

+ Primary care makes outcomes better as shown in heart disease
+ Fire alarm: get before damage
+ peresymptomatic damage (damage befor symptoms manifest)
+ obvious comorbidities cannot distinguish outcomes very well
+ Have to move away from damage based constructs of teh disease
+ prognostic and predictive biomarkers
