## Abstract format

+ A. Cover Page
The cover page should follow the same format as the full proposal described in Section 4.2.2.A.
The cover page does not count towards the page limit.
+ B. Concept Summary
Describe the proposed concept with minimal jargon and explain how it addresses the topic
area(s) of the R&D Solicitation.
+ C. Innovation and Impact
Clearly identify the health outcome(s) sought and/or the problem(s) to be solved with the
proposed technology concept. Describe how the proposed effort represents an innovative and
potentially revolutionary solution to the technical challenges posed by the R&D Solicitation.
Explain the concept’s potential to be disruptive compared to existing or emerging technologies.
Describe how the concept will have a positive impact on at least one of ARPA-H's mission areas.
To the extent possible, provide quantitative metrics in a table that compares the proposed
technology concept to current and emerging technologies and includes:
• State of the art / emerging technology “baseline”
• Target for proposed technology in its final, commercializable form
• Target for proposed technology at the end of the proposed ARPA-H project
+ D. Proposed Work
Describe the final deliverable(s) for the project, one (1) or two (2) key interim milestones, and
the overall technical approach used to achieve project objectives. Discuss alternative approaches
considered, if any, and why the proposed approach is most appropriate for the project objectives.
Describe the background, theory, simulation, modeling, experimental data, or other sound
engineering and scientific practices or principles that support the proposed approach. Provide
specific examples of supporting data and/or appropriate citations to the scientific and technical 
literature. The list of citations does not count towards the page limit. Identify commercialization
challenges to be overcome for the proposed technology to be successful in the health market.
Describe why the proposed effort is a significant technical challenge and the key technical risks
to the project. At a minimum, the abstract should address:
Does the approach require one or more entirely new technical developments to succeed?
How will technical risk be mitigated?
+ E. Team Organization and Capabilities
Indicate the roles and responsibilities of the organizations and key personnel that comprise the
Project Team. Provide the name, position, and institution of each key team member and describe
in 1-2 sentences the skills and experience they bring to the team.
+ F. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM)
Please include a ROM estimate of timeline and federal funds requested, as well as the total
project cost including cost sharing, if applicable. The ROM should also include a breakdown of
the work by direct labor, labor rates, subcontracts, materials, equipment, other direct costs (e.g.,
travel), indirect costs, profit, cost sharing, and any other relevant costs. Cost sharing is neither
required nor forbidden and is not considered a factor in evaluation.

# Description
Current approaches to vaccine development are costly, time-consuming, and have not yielded
broadly-efficacious vaccines for viral disease. Due to the technical complexities, most
developers target a single virus species as the indication for a given vaccine, as the cost and time
associated with evaluating the clinical efficacy of a vaccine leads to a risk-averse “one-virus,
one-vaccine” development strategy. Novel protein structure prediction algorithms, such as
AlphaFold2 (AF2) and RoseTTAFold (RF), have revolutionized protein structure prediction for
various applications and have the potential – when combined with high-throughput functional
experimentation discoveries – to unlock new possibilities within vaccine development
approaches. However, the effectiveness of these algorithms correlates with the amount of
experimentally-resolved structure data found in the open-source Protein Data Bank (PDB). The
PDB’s structural repertoire is significantly biased toward soluble eukaryotic and bacterial
proteins, with viral proteins constituting less than 6% of the total. Additionally, the existing
prediction algorithms face challenges in accurately predicting the impact of mutations, post-
translational modifications, multi-domain structures, and protein-protein interactions. These core
capabilities are essential for in silico approaches to design vaccine Ag that create immune
responses that are protective at the relevant mucosal surfaces and provide durable protection
beyond a single virus species. These tools have not been paired with orthogonal data generation
from functional assessments that would generate data beneficial to vaccine Ag design.

APECx will address these limitations by:

1. Discovering and optimizing new methodologies to generate the necessary structural and
functional data needed for modeling viral Ag and incorporating these data into vaccine
design tool development – and sharing these data openly
2. Building Artificial intelligence (AI)/Machine learning (ML)-enabled vaccine design tools
for translational vaccine and therapeutic development – and sharing these tools openly
3. Demonstrating the predictive and learning abilities of these tools through proof-of-
concept studies that evaluate their applicability to broad-spectrum vaccine development
4. Challenging the developers to demonstrate genus/family-level efficacy of these vaccine
candidates with independent and validated assays and models
5. Down-selecting the most promising candidates for evaluation in Phase I human clinical
studies to demonstrate the capabilities built into the antigen development pipeline



# TA1 TA2 TA3

+ Technical Area 1 (TA1)- High-throughput (HT) Biochemical Analysis and Protein
Engineering: Accelerated throughput of viral Ag discovery with high accuracy, utilizing
techniques including but not limited to HT experimental structure determination, HT
functional analysis, and model system development for screening of lead Ag candidates.
+ Technical Area 2 (TA2)- Protein Modeling Toolkit for Antigen Design: Leverage 3-
dimensional (3D) structural and HT functional data information from TA1 and existing
viral protein structure data to confidently model challenging targets and predict and
design consensus chimeric Ag suitable for genus-level vaccines against existing and
emerging viral diseases. (TA2)- Discovery Pipeline Development: APECx will also
prioritize integrated model development by soliciting TA2 Only performers to
develop, train, and test team-developed toolkits across the performers (inclusive of
training data and models developed).
+ Technical Area 3 (TA3)- Translational Candidate Development and Clinical
Evaluation: Utilize the dataset generated by TA1 and TA2 to discover novel MCMs,
optimize them for relevant delivery platforms that are efficacious at a viral genus-level
and easily accessible to the public, and iteratively validate approaches generated by TA1
and TA2.
