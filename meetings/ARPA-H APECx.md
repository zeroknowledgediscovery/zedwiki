# Description
Current approaches to vaccine development are costly, time-consuming, and have not yielded
broadly-efficacious vaccines for viral disease. Due to the technical complexities, most
developers target a single virus species as the indication for a given vaccine, as the cost and time
associated with evaluating the clinical efficacy of a vaccine leads to a risk-averse “one-virus,
one-vaccine” development strategy. Novel protein structure prediction algorithms, such as
AlphaFold2 (AF2) and RoseTTAFold (RF), have revolutionized protein structure prediction for
various applications and have the potential – when combined with high-throughput functional
experimentation discoveries – to unlock new possibilities within vaccine development
approaches. However, the effectiveness of these algorithms correlates with the amount of
experimentally-resolved structure data found in the open-source Protein Data Bank (PDB). The
PDB’s structural repertoire is significantly biased toward soluble eukaryotic and bacterial
proteins, with viral proteins constituting less than 6% of the total. Additionally, the existing
prediction algorithms face challenges in accurately predicting the impact of mutations, post-
translational modifications, multi-domain structures, and protein-protein interactions. These core
capabilities are essential for in silico approaches to design vaccine Ag that create immune
responses that are protective at the relevant mucosal surfaces and provide durable protection
beyond a single virus species. These tools have not been paired with orthogonal data generation
from functional assessments that would generate data beneficial to vaccine Ag design.

APECx will address these limitations by:

1. Discovering and optimizing new methodologies to generate the necessary structural and
functional data needed for modeling viral Ag and incorporating these data into vaccine
design tool development – and sharing these data openly
2. Building Artificial intelligence (AI)/Machine learning (ML)-enabled vaccine design tools
for translational vaccine and therapeutic development – and sharing these tools openly
3. Demonstrating the predictive and learning abilities of these tools through proof-of-
concept studies that evaluate their applicability to broad-spectrum vaccine development
4. Challenging the developers to demonstrate genus/family-level efficacy of these vaccine
candidates with independent and validated assays and models
5. Down-selecting the most promising candidates for evaluation in Phase I human clinical
studies to demonstrate the capabilities built into the antigen development pipeline



# TA1 TA2 TA3

+ Technical Area 1 (TA1)- High-throughput (HT) Biochemical Analysis and Protein
Engineering: Accelerated throughput of viral Ag discovery with high accuracy, utilizing
techniques including but not limited to HT experimental structure determination, HT
functional analysis, and model system development for screening of lead Ag candidates.
+ Technical Area 2 (TA2)- Protein Modeling Toolkit for Antigen Design: Leverage 3-
dimensional (3D) structural and HT functional data information from TA1 and existing
viral protein structure data to confidently model challenging targets and predict and
design consensus chimeric Ag suitable for genus-level vaccines against existing and
emerging viral diseases. (TA2)- Discovery Pipeline Development: APECx will also
prioritize integrated model development by soliciting TA2 Only performers to
develop, train, and test team-developed toolkits across the performers (inclusive of
training data and models developed).
+ Technical Area 3 (TA3)- Translational Candidate Development and Clinical
Evaluation: Utilize the dataset generated by TA1 and TA2 to discover novel MCMs,
optimize them for relevant delivery platforms that are efficacious at a viral genus-level
and easily accessible to the public, and iteratively validate approaches generated by TA1
and TA2.
