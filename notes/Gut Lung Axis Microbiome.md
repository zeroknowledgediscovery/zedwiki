**Combining Large-scale  Electronic Health Records  with  Longitudinal Microbiome Profiles in Size-limited Cohorts To Reduce Future-risk of Respiratory Dysbiosis via Operationalizing the  Gut-lung Axis**

Pneumonia accounts for more deaths than any other infectious disease worldwide. The intestinal microbiota supports local mucosal immunity and is increasingly recognised as an important modulator of the systemic immune system. The precise role of the gut microbiota in bacterial pneumonia, however, is unknown. Here, we investigate the function of the gut microbiota in the host defence against Streptococcus pneumoniae infections~\cite{Schuijt575}.
It has been shown in animal models that gut microbiota protects the host during pneumococcal pneumonia, as reflected by increased bacterial dissemination, inflammation, organ damage and mortality in microbiota-depleted mice compared with controls~\cite{Schuijt575}. 

Studies have investigated the riole of intestinal microbiota as a protective mediator during pneumococcal pneumonia. The gut microbiota enhances primary alveolar macrophage function. Novel therapeutic strategies could exploit the gut–lung axis in bacterial infections.

The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and respiratory tract, although separate organs, are part of a shared mucosal immune system termed the gut–lung axis.

The microbiota of the GIT and the respiratory tract are involved in the gut–lung axis, influencing immune responses both locally and at distant sites.

Current research has identified specific bacterial taxa, their components and metabolites that can influence host immunity.

 Expansion of the gut microbiota begins immediately after birth and is heavily influenced by environmental factors, with species in the phylum Actinobacteria often dominating during infancy123,124. In this early period of life, changes in the microbiota may be linked to the development of chronic lung disorders in later life~\cite{budden2017emerging}.
