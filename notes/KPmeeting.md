Go to event, and put 3 pages.

Designed to provide 2-3 years of funding for 3 to 5 proposals of prospective AI/ML implementation-
effectiveness studies in U.S. health systems
–Total budget of up to $750,000 for each project
KP-DOR is the Coordinating Center overseeing this work and will be advised by a National Advisory 
Committee
Interested research applicants can submit a 3-page Letter of Intent (LOI) due on June 30, 2023
–Drawn from the LOI proposals, up to 12 applicant teams will be invited to submit a 12-page full 
application due on October 13, 2023


+ Generalizability of algorithms across new datasets and settings
+ In a 3-page narrative, describe the:
    + Proposed clinical diagnostic use case;
    + AI/ML algorithm and its performance;
    + Implementation and evaluation design proposed; and 
    + Team and health system setting collaborating in the proposal

Diagnostic decision-making as specific area of focus
+ Estimated millions of Americans subjected to medical errors each year
    –Diagnostic error identified as the major contributor
+ AI/ML algorithms offer uniquely powerful capability to enhance diagnostic excellence
    –Improving clinician diagnostic risk stratification, decision-making, diagnostic testing approaches, 
and intervention

Cancer, acute vascular events, and acute infection subject to diagnostic challenges
Noted as a priority area for Moore Foundation
• However, we will accept applications across any medical or healthcare domain

Funding is not intended to support new or ongoing development of algorithms, except where used to 
verify performance and support evaluation in a new healthcare setting.
