Rare or extreme events are events that occur with low frequency, and often refers to infrequent events that have widespread impact and which might destabilize systems (for example, stock markets,[1] ocean wave intensity[2] or optical fibers [3] or society[4]). Rare events encompass natural phenomena (major earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, asteroid impacts, solar flares, etc.), anthropogenic hazards (warfare and related forms of violent conflict, acts of terrorism, industrial accidents, financial and commodity market crashes, etc.), as well as phenomena for which natural and anthropogenic factors interact in complex ways (epidemic disease spread, global warming-related changes in climate and weather, etc.).

 Consider the following events: a pressure tank within a rocket propulsion system fails  during a launch; tectonic plates shift, causing the first significant earthquake in a lo cale for several decades; a stock market experiences a crash after a prolonged run-up  in price levels. The commonality here is that all of these events are ultimately charac terized by a "rupture" in the underlying system, following a buildup of "pressure"
 over a period of time. The recognition of certain engineering and geologic events as  analogous in this way to financial market crashes was the impetus for the interesting  and enjoyable new book *Why Stock Markets Crash: Critical Events in Complex Financial
 Systems*, by Didier Sornette.
 
  The major thesis of this book is that a stock market crash is not the result of short-term  exogenous events, but rather involves a long-term endogenous buildup, with exoge nous events acting merely as triggers. In particular, Sornette examines financial crashes  within the framework of the "spontaneous emergence of extreme events in self- organizing systems," noting that "extreme events are characteristic of many... 'complex systems."' The author employs mathematical tools-specifically, log-periodic  power laws-to study the prebubble or precrash buildup in a financial system to its  critical point.

 It turns out that most complex systems around us do exhibit rare and sudden transitions, that occur over time
intervals that are short compared with the characteristic time scales of their posterior evolution. Such extreme events
express more than anything else the underlying “forces” usually hidden by almost perfect balance, and thus provide
the potential for a better scientific understanding of complex systems. These crises have fundamental societal
impacts and range from large natural catastrophes, catastrophic events of environmental degradation, to the failure
of engineering structures, crashes in the stock market, social unrest leading to large-scale strikes and upheaval,
economic drawdowns on national and global scales, regional power blackouts, traffic gridlock, diseases and epidemics,
etc. **It is essential to realize that the long-term behaviour of these complex systems is often controlled in large part by these rare catastrophic events:** the universe was probably born during an extreme explosion  (the  “big-bang”);  the nucleosynthesis of most important atomic elements constituting our matter results from the colossal explosion of
supernovae; the largest earthquake in California repeating about once every two centuries accounts for a significant
fraction of the total tectonic deformation; landscapes are more shaped by the “millennium” flood that moves large
boulders rather than the action of all other eroding agents; the largest volcanic eruptions lead to major topographic
changes as well as severe climatic disruptions; evolution is characterized by phases of quasi-stasis interrupted by
episodic bursts of activity and destruction;  financial crashes can destroy in an instant trillions of dollars;
political crises and revolutions shape the long-term geopolitical landscape; even our personal life is shaped on the long
run by a few key decisions and happenings.
