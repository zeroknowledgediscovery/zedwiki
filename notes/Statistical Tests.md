# Wilcoxon signed-rank test

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test used either to test the location of a set of samples or to compare the locations of two populations using a set of matched samples.[1] When applied to test the location of a set of samples, it serves the same purpose as the one-sample Student's t-test.[2] On a set of matched samples, it is a paired difference test like the paired Student's t-test (also known as the "t-test for matched pairs" or "t-test for dependent samples"). Unlike the Student's t-test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test does not assume that the data is normally distributed. On a wide variety of data sets, it has greater statistical power than the Student's t-test and is more likely to produce a statistically significant result. The cost of this applicability is that it has less statistical power than the Student's t-test when the data is normally distributed.
