I have broad research intersts, which is  challneging to talk  about in 15 minutes. Hence I will stick to my broad vision, what I set out to achieve, where I am  in that path (results), and where I intend to go in future. 

# ZeDLab Vision

I am interested in intrinsic properties of data, how we can distill knowledge/actionable insights, and answer hard questions in biomedicine and the social sciences. We live in the age of data, and we can now imagine an update to the scientific method itself. Instead of classical cycle: make hypotheses -- test in experiments -- refine hypotheses, we can envision a process in which hypotheses are learned from data itself. Now, ML has made great strides, but we still are limited by a requirement of pre-selecting good features, and for that yopu need a lot of domain knowledge. I am interested in exploring if we can go further, instead of opaque solutions to individual problems, can we develop zero-knowledge pattern discovery tools to accelerate science.


# Foundational Insights

Data from different problem domains have different formats, contexts and relates to different questions of interest.
