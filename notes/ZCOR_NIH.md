> The purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is to invite pragmatic clinical trial applications to test paradigms designed to address the unmet need to detect cognitive impairment, including dementia, in large and diverse populations seen in primary care across the United States when a patient, relative, or care provider indicates concern. Applications must propose pragmatic clinical trials to test paradigms to detect cognitive impairment, including dementia, with adequate power in up to 3 populations including at least two specified populations that experience health disparities. Clinical paradigms proposed for pragmatic clinical trials should have rigorous supporting preliminary data and utilize tools that are simple to use, standardized, integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR) workflow, and ideally take five minutes or less to administer in a primary care clinical setting. Paradigms must provide standardized and implementable turnkey guidance via the EMR to the care provider for follow-up based on results of either “no objective cognitive impairment detected” or “cognitive impairment possible or detected”.

Applications Not-Responsive to this FOA

This FOA is only for studies related to humans; animal or other disease model studies are not responsive to this FOA.

+ Applications that propose clinical trials to test drug interventions are not-responsive to this FOA.

+ Delayed-Onset Trials.

+ Applications that do no include at least two populations that experience health disparities.

+ Applications that are not focused on pragmatic clinical trials for implementing rapid (10 minutes of primary care provider time or less) paradigm(s) for detecting cognitive impairment, including dementia in large human populations in the United States are not responsive.

+ Applications that do not link the proposed paradigm(s) to the EMR.

+ Applications that do not link the proposed paradigm(s) to billing.

+ Applications which do not include paradigms for detecting cognitive impairment, including dementia, which already have evidence of efficacy in the studied populations are not responsive.

+ Applications that do not indicate how they will make their paradigm(s) available for others to utilize both during the funding period (e.g., at a minimum, to other consortium members), and after, including how and with minimum burden, are not responsive.

+ Applications that focus on related topics that are not central to the goals of this FOA, such as differentiating among cognitive domains, determining the degree of cognitive impairment and whether the cognitive impairment detected does or does not meet criteria for dementia, and differentiating among different dementia disorders, are not responsive.

+ Applications that propose mechanistic clinical trials or BESH clinical trials are not responsive.



# James Comments

diagnostic work up for patients that would be referred for dementia. I think this would require more work, although my time is currently limited. 

+ I really think that a fantastic grant would be to apply your zCor and all those subjects who score “at risk” get a biomarker assessment of an MRI of the brain to assess cerebrovascular disease burden, which may be what zCor picks up the most, as it seems to identify cardiovascular risks that would contribute to vascular dementia. 
+ In addition, since our tests can detect Alzheimer’s several years, if not a decade before development of symptoms, we could screen all high risk subjects with amyloid PET scans or spinal taps (see the attached document) to assess for underlying AD.

+ One limitation of biomarkers to predict specific diseases processes is that only Alzheimer’s can be detected early on. We don’t have biomarkers for other major dementias. But since Alzheimer’s is the most common in the elderly, I think it would still be worthwhile.
+ I’m also sending you a nice paper on the overview of diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease, which has elements of what I discuss in the diagnostic work up.
