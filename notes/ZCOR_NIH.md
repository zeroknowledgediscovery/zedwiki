# Pragmatic Clinical Trial

Applications must propose pragmatic clinical trials to test paradigms to detect cognitive impairment, including dementia, with adequate power in up to 3 populations including at least two specified populations that experience health disparities.

+ older African Americans, Hispanics and other populations that experience health disparities than among older whites.
+ Paradigms proposed must be supported by rigorous preliminary data that justifies proceeding to a pragmatic clinical trial.
+  race/ethnicity (African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, Asian Americans, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders), low socioeconomic status, rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender).


## Definition of a Pragmatic Clinical Trial
According to Califf and Sugarman, there are “three key attributes of PCTs: (1) an intent to inform decision-makers (patients, clinicians, administrators, and policy-makers), as opposed to elucidating a biological or social mechanism; (2) an intent to enroll a population relevant to the decision in practice and representative of the patients or populations and clinical settings for whom the decision is relevant; and (3) either an intent to (a) streamline procedures and data collection so that the trial can focus on adequate power for informing the clinical and policy decisions targeted by the trial or (b) measure a broad range of outcomes. Given these attributes, a common-sense definition for a PCT would thus be as follows:

> Designed for the primary purpose of informing decision-makers regarding the comparative balance of benefits, burdens and risks of a biomedical or behavioral health intervention at the individual or population level. (Califf and Sugarman 2015).

+ large efficient study in real world provides evidence for adoption of an intervention into clinical practice
+ EHR | outcomes important to decision makers | interventions in routinbe clinical workflow | diversity study populations
 

# Responsive Characteristics 

+ Applications must propose pragmatic clinical trial(s).

+ Applications should identify and evaluate the risks and consequences of over- or under-detection of cognitive impairment using the proposed paradigm(s).

+ Pragmatic clinical trials involving populations that experience health disparities must identify the **major (hypothesized) barriers** resulting in delay and/or lack detection of cognitive impairment, including dementia, in the specific population, and clearly indicate which of these barriers are proposed to be **overcome by using the paradigm**.

+ Proposed pragmatic clinical trials must be sufficiently powered to definitively test proposed paradigms in at least three U.S. populations for detecting cognitive impairment, including dementia, in aging populations, at least two of which must be populations that experience health disparities.

+ Attention should be paid to consideration of when the paradigm(s) should and should not be used (e.g. settings, state of the patient).

+ Applicants should make their paradigm(s) available for others to utilize after the funding period, including how the paradigm(s) will be made available and with minimum cost and burden.

+ Projects should include a paradigm or paradigms that have preliminary evidence of efficacy and safety in the populations to be included in the trial.

+ Projects should address **potential longer term goals for establishing feasibility and effectiveness**, and how the proposed research will facilitate those goals by establishing an essential foundation for future efforts. Specifically, applicants must provide descriptions of: (i) how the research will yield **information critical for next steps**, including for widespread implementation of developed paradigm(s); (ii) how, including via utilizing paradigm(s) further developed and validated under this FOA, together with other appropriate strategies, **it will be possible to fully assess the need and the potential impact in the United States for routinely detecting cognitive impairment, including dementia, in everyday clinical settings, including in primary care.**

+ For applications that propose pragmatic clinical trials that are ancillary studies, the application must provide evidence that data collection on any additional outcome measures proposed in the ancillary study must be completed within the timeline of the parent study (analysis can extend beyond the parent study timeline).

> The purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is to invite pragmatic clinical trial applications to test paradigms designed to address the unmet need to detect cognitive impairment, including dementia, in large and diverse populations seen in primary care across the United States when a patient, relative, or care provider indicates concern. Applications must propose pragmatic clinical trials to test paradigms to detect cognitive impairment, including dementia, with adequate power in up to 3 populations including at least two specified populations that experience health disparities. Clinical paradigms proposed for pragmatic clinical trials should have rigorous supporting preliminary data and utilize tools that are simple to use, standardized, integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR) workflow, and ideally take five minutes or less to administer in a primary care clinical setting. Paradigms must provide standardized and implementable turnkey guidance via the EMR to the care provider for follow-up based on results of either “no objective cognitive impairment detected” or “cognitive impairment possible or detected”.

# Applications Not-Responsive to this FOA

This FOA is only for studies related to humans; animal or other disease model studies are not responsive to this FOA.

+ Applications that propose clinical trials to test drug interventions are not-responsive to this FOA.

+ Delayed-Onset Trials.

+ Applications that do no include at least two populations that experience health disparities.

+ Applications that are not focused on pragmatic clinical trials for implementing rapid (10 minutes of primary care provider time or less) paradigm(s) for detecting cognitive impairment, including dementia in large human populations in the United States are not responsive.

+ **Applications that do not link the proposed paradigm(s) to the EMR.**

+ **Applications that do not link the proposed paradigm(s) to billing.**

+ **Applications which do not include paradigms for detecting cognitive impairment, including dementia, which already have evidence of efficacy in the studied populations are not responsive.**

+ **Applications that do not indicate how they will make their paradigm(s) available for others to utilize both during the funding period (e.g., at a minimum, to other consortium members), and after, including how and with minimum burden, are not responsive.**

+ Applications that focus on related topics that are not central to the goals of this FOA, such as differentiating among cognitive domains, determining the degree of cognitive impairment and whether the cognitive impairment detected does or does not meet criteria for dementia, and differentiating among different dementia disorders, are not responsive.

+ Applications that propose mechanistic clinical trials or BESH clinical trials are not responsive.



# James Comments

diagnostic work up for patients that would be referred for dementia. I think this would require more work, although my time is currently limited. 

+ I really think that a fantastic grant would be to apply your zCor and all those subjects who score “at risk” get a biomarker assessment of an MRI of the brain to assess cerebrovascular disease burden, which may be what zCor picks up the most, as it seems to identify cardiovascular risks that would contribute to vascular dementia. 
+ In addition, since our tests can detect Alzheimer’s several years, if not a decade before development of symptoms, we could screen all high risk subjects with amyloid PET scans or spinal taps (see the attached document) to assess for underlying AD.

+ One limitation of biomarkers to predict specific diseases processes is that only Alzheimer’s can be detected early on. We don’t have biomarkers for other major dementias. But since Alzheimer’s is the most common in the elderly, I think it would still be worthwhile.
+ I’m also sending you a nice paper on the overview of diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease, which has elements of what I discuss in the diagnostic work up.

# Other Documents

+ Applicants are required to include the following items in the Other Project Information section of the application: (i) Intellectual Property Strategy; and (ii) Team Management Plan for the proposed research project. 
+ Team Management Plan for the proposed research project: Each application submitted in response to this FOA must have a Team Management Plan for the research proposed within the application's specific aims. The project Team Management Plan must not exceed two pages. Applications that exceed this limit will be withdrawn. NIH strongly encourages applicants to form multidisciplinary teams that consist of non-clinical and clinical scientists, cognitive, statistical, population-based clinical research, and other relevant academic/industry experts and, as applicable, health disparities disease experts. This multi-disciplinary team should have the expertise needed to execute the research strategy, and include representation from the health system(s) involved. The Team Management Plan should describe how team members will collaborate to accomplish the aims as proposed.

# Letter of Support
Letters of support from participating HCS are required.
+ memory center
+ CRI
+ geriatric clinics

# Resource Sharing
Applications funded under this FOA are expected to provide a specific plan for sharing paradigm(s), including tool(s), with Consortium collaborators , and very broadly with others at the conclusion of this 5 year program, consistent with achieving the goals of the program.

# Availability of Appropriate Institutional Resources

Applicants must provide strong evidence of the availability of appropriate institutional resources, and suitable patient populations, providers, clinics, or facilities (depending on unit of randomization). Documentation of availability of eligible participants, clinic sites, or units of randomization, presented in tabular format must be provided. The application must include relevant information that addresses the feasibility of recruiting participants who are eligible for the pragmatic trial implementation study. Specifically, applicants must provide evidence that each recruiting center in the study or trial has access to a sufficient number of participants who meet the eligibility criteria as defined in the submitted protocol. For multisite applications, information must be provided for each participating site.

# Recruitment

The participant recruitment and retention plans must include a discussion of the availability of participants for the proposed study and the ability of enrollment sites to recruit and retain the proposed number of participants meeting the eligibility criteria, including women and minority participants as applicable. Data supporting recruitment and retention estimates must be provided. Evidence should be provided that relevant stakeholders (e.g., potential participants, referring and treating physicians, patient groups) have sufficient equipoise, consider the question to be important and the study acceptable.

For a multicenter trial, applicants should survey the potential clinical sites to ensure that recruitment targets can be met. Present the survey results using a table where the rows represent potential clinical sites and the columns include responses to questions from the survey. The survey questions will depend on the nature of the trial and the protocol-specified screening procedures but might include these:

+ Has the PD/PI previously recruited patients with this disease into a clinical trial?
+ Does this site have all necessary equipment to complete eligibility evaluations?
+ If not, how far (in miles) will patients need to travel to complete eligibility evaluations?
+ What is the total number of patients seen at this site in the past 12 months?
+ How many of these appear to meet the pre-screening eligibility criteria?
+ How many of these are likely to be found fully eligible and consent to be enrolled?
+ Do the sites have appropriate demographics to comply with the Inclusion of women and minorities NIH Policy?
+ Is there a clear plan for recruitment of diverse patients, based on the patient population seen at that facility or in the local community?
