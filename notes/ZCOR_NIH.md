diagnostic work up for patients that would be referred for dementia. I think this would require more work, although my time is currently limited. 

+ I really think that a fantastic grant would be to apply your zCor and all those subjects who score “at risk” get a biomarker assessment of an MRI of the brain to assess cerebrovascular disease burden, which may be what zCor picks up the most, as it seems to identify cardiovascular risks that would contribute to vascular dementia. 
+ In addition, since our tests can detect Alzheimer’s several years, if not a decade before development of symptoms, we could screen all high risk subjects with amyloid PET scans or spinal taps (see the attached document) to assess for underlying AD.

+ One limitation of biomarkers to predict specific diseases processes is that only Alzheimer’s can be detected early on. We don’t have biomarkers for other major dementias. But since Alzheimer’s is the most common in the elderly, I think it would still be worthwhile.
+ I’m also sending you a nice paper on the overview of diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease, which has elements of what I discuss in the diagnostic work up.
