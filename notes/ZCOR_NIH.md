# Pragmatic Clinical Trial

Applications must propose pragmatic clinical trials to test paradigms to detect cognitive impairment, including dementia, with adequate power in up to 3 populations including at least two specified populations that experience health disparities.

+ older African Americans, Hispanics and other populations that experience health disparities than among older whites.
+ Paradigms proposed must be supported by rigorous preliminary data that justifies proceeding to a pragmatic clinical trial.
+  race/ethnicity (African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, Asian Americans, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders), low socioeconomic status, rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender).


## Definition of a Pragmatic Clinical Trial
According to Califf and Sugarman, there are “three key attributes of PCTs: (1) an intent to inform decision-makers (patients, clinicians, administrators, and policy-makers), as opposed to elucidating a biological or social mechanism; (2) an intent to enroll a population relevant to the decision in practice and representative of the patients or populations and clinical settings for whom the decision is relevant; and (3) either an intent to (a) streamline procedures and data collection so that the trial can focus on adequate power for informing the clinical and policy decisions targeted by the trial or (b) measure a broad range of outcomes. Given these attributes, a common-sense definition for a PCT would thus be as follows:

> Designed for the primary purpose of informing decision-makers regarding the comparative balance of benefits, burdens and risks of a biomedical or behavioral health intervention at the individual or population level. (Califf and Sugarman 2015).

+ large efficient study in real world provides evidence for adoption of an intervention into clinical practice
+ EHR | outcomes important to decision makers | interventions in routinbe clinical workflow | diversity study populations
 

# Responsive Characteristics 

+ Applications must propose pragmatic clinical trial(s).

+ Applications should identify and evaluate the risks and consequences of over- or under-detection of cognitive impairment using the proposed paradigm(s).

+ Pragmatic clinical trials involving populations that experience health disparities must identify the **major (hypothesized) barriers** resulting in delay and/or lack detection of cognitive impairment, including dementia, in the specific population, and clearly indicate which of these barriers are proposed to be **overcome by using the paradigm**.

+ Proposed pragmatic clinical trials must be sufficiently powered to definitively test proposed paradigms in at least three U.S. populations for detecting cognitive impairment, including dementia, in aging populations, at least two of which must be populations that experience health disparities.

+ Attention should be paid to consideration of when the paradigm(s) should and should not be used (e.g. settings, state of the patient).

+ Applicants should make their paradigm(s) available for others to utilize after the funding period, including how the paradigm(s) will be made available and with minimum cost and burden.

+ Projects should include a paradigm or paradigms that have preliminary evidence of efficacy and safety in the populations to be included in the trial.

+ Projects should address **potential longer term goals for establishing feasibility and effectiveness**, and how the proposed research will facilitate those goals by establishing an essential foundation for future efforts. Specifically, applicants must provide descriptions of: (i) how the research will yield **information critical for next steps**, including for widespread implementation of developed paradigm(s); (ii) how, including via utilizing paradigm(s) further developed and validated under this FOA, together with other appropriate strategies, **it will be possible to fully assess the need and the potential impact in the United States for routinely detecting cognitive impairment, including dementia, in everyday clinical settings, including in primary care.**

+ For applications that propose pragmatic clinical trials that are ancillary studies, the application must provide evidence that data collection on any additional outcome measures proposed in the ancillary study must be completed within the timeline of the parent study (analysis can extend beyond the parent study timeline).

> The purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is to invite pragmatic clinical trial applications to test paradigms designed to address the unmet need to detect cognitive impairment, including dementia, in large and diverse populations seen in primary care across the United States when a patient, relative, or care provider indicates concern. Applications must propose pragmatic clinical trials to test paradigms to detect cognitive impairment, including dementia, with adequate power in up to 3 populations including at least two specified populations that experience health disparities. Clinical paradigms proposed for pragmatic clinical trials should have rigorous supporting preliminary data and utilize tools that are simple to use, standardized, integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR) workflow, and ideally take five minutes or less to administer in a primary care clinical setting. Paradigms must provide standardized and implementable turnkey guidance via the EMR to the care provider for follow-up based on results of either “no objective cognitive impairment detected” or “cognitive impairment possible or detected”.

# Applications Not-Responsive to this FOA

This FOA is only for studies related to humans; animal or other disease model studies are not responsive to this FOA.

+ Applications that propose clinical trials to test drug interventions are not-responsive to this FOA.

+ Delayed-Onset Trials.

+ Applications that do no include at least two populations that experience health disparities.

+ Applications that are not focused on pragmatic clinical trials for implementing rapid (10 minutes of primary care provider time or less) paradigm(s) for detecting cognitive impairment, including dementia in large human populations in the United States are not responsive.

+ **Applications that do not link the proposed paradigm(s) to the EMR.**

+ **Applications that do not link the proposed paradigm(s) to billing.**

+ **Applications which do not include paradigms for detecting cognitive impairment, including dementia, which already have evidence of efficacy in the studied populations are not responsive.**

+ **Applications that do not indicate how they will make their paradigm(s) available for others to utilize both during the funding period (e.g., at a minimum, to other consortium members), and after, including how and with minimum burden, are not responsive.**

+ Applications that focus on related topics that are not central to the goals of this FOA, such as differentiating among cognitive domains, determining the degree of cognitive impairment and whether the cognitive impairment detected does or does not meet criteria for dementia, and differentiating among different dementia disorders, are not responsive.

+ Applications that propose mechanistic clinical trials or BESH clinical trials are not responsive.



# James Comments

diagnostic work up for patients that would be referred for dementia. I think this would require more work, although my time is currently limited. 

+ I really think that a fantastic grant would be to apply your zCor and all those subjects who score “at risk” get a biomarker assessment of an MRI of the brain to assess cerebrovascular disease burden, which may be what zCor picks up the most, as it seems to identify cardiovascular risks that would contribute to vascular dementia. 
+ In addition, since our tests can detect Alzheimer’s several years, if not a decade before development of symptoms, we could screen all high risk subjects with amyloid PET scans or spinal taps (see the attached document) to assess for underlying AD.

+ One limitation of biomarkers to predict specific diseases processes is that only Alzheimer’s can be detected early on. We don’t have biomarkers for other major dementias. But since Alzheimer’s is the most common in the elderly, I think it would still be worthwhile.
+ I’m also sending you a nice paper on the overview of diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease, which has elements of what I discuss in the diagnostic work up.
