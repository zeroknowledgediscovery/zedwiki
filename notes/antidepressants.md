# Bupropion

Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction.[26] Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.[27] In depressed people who experience symptoms of sleepiness and fatigue, bupropion has been found to be more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in alleviating these symptoms.[28] There appears to be a modest advantage for the SSRIs over bupropion in the treatment of anxious depression.[29]
