# gender diffrenced

Most studies, but not all, report an almost equal gender ratio in the prevalence of bipolar disorder but the majority of studies do report an increased risk in women of bipolar II/hypomania, rapid cycling and mixed episodes. 


No consistent gender differences have been found in a number of variables including rates of depressive episodes, age and polarity of onset, symptoms, severity of the illness, response to treatment and suicidal behaviour. Unsurprisingly, however, perhaps the major distinction between men and women with bipolar disorder is the impact that reproductive life events, particularly childbirth, have on women with this diagnosis.


*Important gender distinctions are also found in patterns of co-morbidity.*

Finally, the three risk factors identified by
Model 5 provide a negative predictive value of 0.96 but a positive
predictive value of 0.25 only, thus they are useful only to exclude
the risk of switch.

Limitations: Limitations of the present study should be mentioned. Firstly,
switch from depression to mania was not directly reported in the
CMF form thus it was derived from clinical status changes during
follow-up. The CMF clinical status was based on several clinical
evaluations of depressive and manic symptoms that were tested
for being switch risk factors. In other words, no independent in-
struments were used to assess the diagnosis of depression (that
was used to build the dependent variable) and some of the clinical
characteristics that were used as independent variables. Secondly,
some possible stratification factors could have biased our results.
In particular, the effect of drug doses and drug combinations was
not included, as well as different bipolar spectrum diagnoses.
Anyway, other studies focusing on the phenomenon of switch
considered the diagnosis of manic/mixed episode as the inclusion
criteria rather than a definite type of bipolar spectrum disorder
(Vieta et al., 2009).

ipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic disease characterized by the
alternation of periods of (hypo)mania and depression, resulting in
high personal and socio-economic burden in terms of poor quality
of life, increased rates of suicide, direct and indirect costs (Ferrari
et al., 2012; Conus et al., 2013; Fagiolini et al., 2013; Kleine-Budde
et al., 2013; Whiteford et al., 2013). The course of BD is highly
variable, thus the identification of individuals at higher risk of
experiencing a more severe course has relevant implications for
both patients and public health care.
Switch from depression to (hypo)mania or mixed status is a
critical issue since its high impact on disease severity. Indeed, pa-
tients with one or more episodes of switch have longer periods of
illness lifetime and higher risk of suicide; further, they experience
more comorbidities (e.g. substance abuse) (Maj et al., 2002;
MacKinnon et al., 2003a, 2003b, 2005). Thus, the identification of
switch risk factors represents a pivotal issue in order to prevent this
detrimental event and improve BD prognosis. Previous studies
investigated antidepressant (AD)-related switch in patients with
BD, and they suggested a number of risk factors (see
Supplementary Table S1 for a summary). On the basis of the results
observed in the largest samples, the most replicated risk factors
were previous history of switch or rapid cycling, younger onset age,
and BD I diagnosis (Serretti et al., 2003; Perlis et al., 2010; Valenti
et al., 2012). One of these studies was performed on the System-
atic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-
BD) sample and it reported several associations between switch
and baseline clinical-demographic features (greater number of past
depressive episodes, recent or lifetime rapid cycling, alcohol use
disorder, previous suicide attempt, past history of AD-emergent
switch, and greater manic symptom severity) (Perlis et al., 2010).
Some of these risk factors were dependent from AD exposure
(younger onset age in patients not treated with ADs; previous
suicide attempt and BD type I diagnosis in AD-exposed patients).

Previous studies were mainly focused on the risk of switch
during AD treatment (Supplementary Table S1), but some patients
with BD experience switch even in the absence of AD treatment.
Indeed, some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggested that a
mood stabilizer plus adjunctive AD therapy, compared with a mood
stabilizer plus a placebo or mood stabilizer monotherapy, showed
no association with higher risk of AD-emergent affective switch
(Keck et al., 2005; Sachs et al., 2007). The first of these RCTs (Sachs
et al., 2007) was carried out on a subsample of the STEP-BD study
and its results could have been biased due to the intervention of
clinicians in the process of randomization (tendency to avoid the
randomization of patients at higher risk of switch). Despite the risk
of inclusion bias deriving from this type of study design, several
neurobiological mechanisms support the risk of spontaneous
switch (Salvadore et al., 2010), thus risk factors of switch should not
be investigated only in relation to concomitant AD treatment.

Previous studies focused on the risk of AD-induced mood switch
suggested that tricyclic ADs (Boerlin et al., 1998; Bottlender et al.,
2001; Nemeroff et al., 2001; Bottlender et al., 2004), monoamine
oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (Boerlin et al., 1998) and venlafaxine
(Leverich et al., 2006; Post et al., 2006) may be associated with
higher risk than SSRIs or bupropion.


# Bupropion

Bupropion is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI).[12]

Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction.[26] Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.[27] In depressed people who experience symptoms of sleepiness and fatigue, bupropion has been found to be more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in alleviating these symptoms.[28] There appears to be a modest advantage for the SSRIs over bupropion in the treatment of anxious depression.[29]
