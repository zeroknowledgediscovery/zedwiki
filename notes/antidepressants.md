# gender diffrenced

Most studies, but not all, report an almost equal gender ratio in the prevalence of bipolar disorder but the majority of studies do report an increased risk in women of bipolar II/hypomania, rapid cycling and mixed episodes. 
** Important gender distinctions are also found in patterns of co-morbidity.**

# Bupropion

Bupropion is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI).[12]

Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction.[26] Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.[27] In depressed people who experience symptoms of sleepiness and fatigue, bupropion has been found to be more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in alleviating these symptoms.[28] There appears to be a modest advantage for the SSRIs over bupropion in the treatment of anxious depression.[29]
