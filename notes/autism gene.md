# Hypothesis

1. * Paroxitine strongly inhibits CYP2D6 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9817620/
2. * CYP2D6 Is Functional in Human Brain In Vivo https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7383223/
3. * astroglial cells are implicated in ASD  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8583956/#:~:text=There%20are%20some%20clinical%20reports,of%20these%20cells%20%5B5%5D.
4. * CYP2D6 is expressed in glial cells https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03602532.2020.1858856
5. * Paroxitine passes from mother to fetus https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30105921/
6. * Our result that Paroxitine has a strong protective effect.

# Paroxetine

* These data are consistent with mechanism-based inhibition (MBI) of CYP2D6 by paroxetine but not by quinidine or fluoxetine. https://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/31/3/289
* Paroxetine strongly inhibits CYP2D6 but no other P45 enzymes
* Fluoxetine also strongly inhibits CYP2D6 but competitively (not MBI)
* Bupropion also might strongly inhibit CYP2D6, but it is not MBI https://tcpharm.org/search.php?where=aview&id=10.12793/jkscpt.2008.16.2.111&code=0179JKSCPT&vmode=FULL

Various types of CYP450 inhibition (competitive, non-competitive, mechanism-based) have been observed clinically, and interactions of these types require a distinct clinical management strategy. This review focuses on mechanism-based inhibition, which occurs when a substrate forms a reactive intermediate, creating a stable enzymeâ€“intermediate complex that irreversibly reduces enzyme activity. This type of inhibition can cause interactions with drugs such as omeprazole, paroxetine, macrolide antibiotics, or mirabegron.

+ CYP2D6 is functional in brain in vivo https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7383223/
+ https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/pgs.14.151 CYP2D6 has been found in neurons in numerous human brain areas, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, and in several layers of the frontal neocortex [4,5] raising questions about its potential role in these neurons. The enzyme was implicated in metabolism of the endogenous compounds 5-methoxytryptamine, anandamide, progesterone and tyramine and in generation of serotonin and dopamine from trace amines [6].

This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that in a transgenic mouse model, with CYP2D6 expressed in the brain, higher serotonin levels have been measured in several brain regions, including the cerebellum and hippocampus [7]. CYP2D6 might also affect the endocannabinoid system within the CNS due to its ability to metabolize anandamide and its derivatives [8]; however, the physiological significance of such metabolism is still unclear.

Associations between CYP2D6 genotypes and personality traits gave the first indications that CYP2D6 might have endogenous functions apart from its important role in drug metabolism. In one of the first reports, it was shown that PMs displayed higher impulsivity-related traits [9], which was confirmed by a later study [10]. Others have found PMs to be more anxiety-prone and less successful in socialization when compared with EMs [11,12]. These heterogeneous results might be related to different ethnicities of the subjects and different methods used for monitoring the personality, but do suggest that CYP2D6 might have an endogenous role in the human brain influencing behavior.
