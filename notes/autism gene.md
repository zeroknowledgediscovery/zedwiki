# Hypothesis

1. * Paroxitine strongly inhibits CYP2D6 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9817620/
2. * CYP2D6 Is Functional in Human Brain In Vivo https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7383223/
3. * astroglial cells are implicated in ASD  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8583956/#:~:text=There%20are%20some%20clinical%20reports,of%20these%20cells%20%5B5%5D.
4. * CYP2D6 is expressed in glial cells https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03602532.2020.1858856
5. * Paroxitine passes from mother to fetus https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30105921/
6. * Our result that Paroxitine has a strong protective effect.

# Paroxetine

* These data are consistent with mechanism-based inhibition (MBI) of CYP2D6 by paroxetine but not by quinidine or fluoxetine. https://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/31/3/289
* Paroxetine strongly inhibits CYP2D6 but no other P45 enzymes
* Fluoxetine also strongly inhibits CYP2D6 but competitively (not MBI)
* Bupropion also might strongly inhibit CYP2D6, but it is not MBI https://tcpharm.org/search.php?where=aview&id=10.12793/jkscpt.2008.16.2.111&code=0179JKSCPT&vmode=FULL

Various types of CYP450 inhibition (competitive, non-competitive, mechanism-based) have been observed clinically, and interactions of these types require a distinct clinical management strategy. This review focuses on mechanism-based inhibition, which occurs when a substrate forms a reactive intermediate, creating a stable enzymeâ€“intermediate complex that irreversibly reduces enzyme activity. This type of inhibition can cause interactions with drugs such as omeprazole, paroxetine, macrolide antibiotics, or mirabegron.
