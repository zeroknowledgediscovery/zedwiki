## Abstract

Society is a complex system shaped by the beliefs of its members. Diverse opinions can facilitate social
learning and adaptation, but polarization can perpetuate separation and conflict. Despite the mechanics
of how social and cultural factors contribute to societal polarization remains unclear. Additionally, the
historical use of diverse polarization measures, and the lack of an objective standard to homogenize
their analysis, has hindered our understanding. Here, we introduce a computational framework (CogNet)
to discover dependencies between individual opinions on diverse topics, to ultimately craft a theory of
belief shift, that is predictive at the level of individuals. Automatically analyzing responses from > 65K US
participants over approximately half a century (1972-2021) from the General Social Survey, and > 3.9M
participants from the European Union over a similar time period from the Eurobarometer surveys,
we distill emergent dependency structures in collective opinion, and demonstrate that our models can
reason with, and reliably predict responses to thousands of controversial social questions, for specific
individuals with a limited amount of information on their worldviews available a priori. CogNet’s opinion
prediction capability, demonstrated by its ability to improve occluded worldview estimates for greater
than 90% and 99% of GSS and Eurobarometer participants respectively, arises from a data-inferred metric
(Gibbs-distance) to measure deviations in the space of opinions. The Gibbs-distance quantifies the
likelihood of spontaneous shift between worldviews, yielding objective computable measures of societal
polarization, which includes the variation of “distance” between two fixed extreme worldviews over time,
offers quantitative evidence that faltering economies anticipate greater polarization. Additionally, we
discover that affective polarization is a likely precursor to ideological polarization, yielding a valuable
insight into how social structures respond to economic stress: opinion clusters increase in numerosity
and move apart, leading to widening gap between dominant ideologies. Such computable frameworks,
validated to capture the intricate dependencies between opinions and the ensuing evolutionary dynanics,
may help foster more effective socio-economic policy, and illuminate new frontiers in social theory.
