Rare or extreme events are events that occur with low frequency, and often refers to infrequent events that have widespread impact and which might destabilize systems (for example, stock markets,[1] ocean wave intensity[2] or optical fibers [3] or society[4]). Rare events encompass natural phenomena (major earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, asteroid impacts, solar flares, etc.), anthropogenic hazards (warfare and related forms of violent conflict, acts of terrorism, industrial accidents, financial and commodity market crashes, etc.), as well as phenomena for which natural and anthropogenic factors interact in complex ways (epidemic disease spread, global warming-related changes in climate and weather, etc.).

 Consider the following events: a pressure tank within a rocket propulsion system fails  during a launch; tectonic plates shift, causing the first significant earthquake in a lo cale for several decades; a stock market experiences a crash after a prolonged run-up  in price levels. The commonality here is that all of these events are ultimately charac terized by a "rupture" in the underlying system, following a buildup of "pressure"
 over a period of time. The recognition of certain engineering and geologic events as  analogous in this way to financial market crashes was the impetus for the interesting  and enjoyable new book *Why Stock Markets Crash: Critical Events in Complex Financial
 Systems*, by Didier Sornette.
 
  The major thesis of this book is that a stock market crash is not the result of short-term  exogenous events, but rather involves a long-term endogenous buildup, with exoge nous events acting merely as triggers. In particular, Sornette examines financial crashes  within the framework of the "spontaneous emergence of extreme events in self- organizing systems," noting that "extreme events are characteristic of many... 'complex systems."' The author employs mathematical tools-specifically, log-periodic  power laws-to study the prebubble or precrash buildup in a financial system to its  critical point.
