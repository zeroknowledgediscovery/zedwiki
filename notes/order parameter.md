# I. Identify the Broken Symmetry

What is it which distinguishes the hundreds of different states of matter? Why do we say that water and olive oil are in the same state (the liquid phase), while we say aluminum and (magnetized) iron are in different states? Through long experience, we've discovered that most phases differ in their symmetry.


The cube has many symmetries. It can be rotated by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or 270 degrees about any of the three axes passing through the faces. It can be rotated by 120 degrees or 240 degrees about the corners, and by 180 degrees about an axis passing from the center through any of the 12 edges. The sphere, though, can be rotated by any angle. The sphere respects rotational invariance: all directions are equal. The cube is an object which breaks rotational symmetry: once the cube is there, some directions are more equal than others.

Consider figure 2, showing a cube and a sphere. Which is more symmetric? Clearly, the sphere has many more symmetries than the cube. One can rotate the cube by 90 degrees in various directions and not change its appearance, but one can rotate the sphere by any angle and keep it unchanged.
