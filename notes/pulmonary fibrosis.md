Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterised by unpredictable disease course and poor survival. After the introduction of novel antifibrotic drugs, the prognosis of patients with IPF is probably changing.

FinnishIPF, a nationwide registry of carefully characterised patients, was initiated in Finland in 2011. For the data analysis, we included 453 incident IPF patients diagnosed during 2011–2015. In this study, we describe the demographics and prognosis of these real-life patients.

The median overall survival time of registered IPF patients was 4.5 years. The transplant-free survival at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years was 95%, 83%, 70%, 58% and 45%, respectively. Smoking did not have any effect on survival. 117 (26%) patients received pirfenidone or nintedanib. Patients who received ≥6 months of treatment had better survival compared with those who did not receive treatment but this difference disappeared after age adjustment. The transplantation rate was 3%.

Although IPF is diagnosed in Finland at a older age, the prognosis is better than expected due to a relatively well preserved lung function at diagnosis. Age and pulmonary function were identified as independent predictors of survival in the entire IPF patient population as well as in patients who had received antifibrotic treatment.

**Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease with an unpredictable course.** An
observational study was set up using the French hospital discharge database to describe
the reasons, outcomes and costs of hospitalisations related to this disease. Patients newly
hospitalised for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis **(ICD-10 code: J84.1)** in 2008 were identified
and followed for 5 years. **As J84.1 includes other fibrotic pulmonary diseases,** an algorithm
excluding age < 50 years and presence of a differential diagnosis in the following year was
defined. Overall, 6,476 patients were identified; of whom 30% were admitted through the
emergency unit and 12% died during their first hospitalisation. Most of patients were hospitalised at least once for one or several acute events (n = 5,635; 87.0% of patients), of whom
36.5% of patients with an acute respiratory worsening (in-hospital mortality of 17.0% and
median cost of €3,224; interquartile range (IQR €889–6,092)), 43.7% of patients with a respiratory infection (in-hospital mortality of 29.5% and median cost of €5,432 (IQR, €3,620–
9,115)) and 51.7% of patients with a cardiac event (in-hospital mortality of 35.7% and
median cost of €4,584 (IQR, €2,803–6,399)); 30.2% of these events occurred during the
first hospitalisation. Finally, the 3-year in-hospital mortality crude rate was 36.8%. This study
is the first providing extensive data on hospitalisations in patients with pulmonary fibrosis,
mostly idiopathic, in France, demonstrating high burden and hospital cost.

J84.1: 

The ICD code J841 is used to code Acute interstitial pneumonitis
Acute interstitial pneumonitis (also known as acute interstitial pneumonia or Hamman–Rich syndrome) is a rare, severe lung disease that usually affects otherwise healthy individuals. There is no known cause or cure.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a specific form of chronic, progressive, fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause and limited to the lungs. It is a rare disease with an incidence estimated at 3.81 per 100,000 inhabitants in Europe [1].
According to an international consensus statement jointly issued by the American Thoracic
Society, the European Respiratory Society, the Japanese Respiratory Society and the Latin
American Thoracic Association, IPF is a distinct clinical entity associated with the histological
and/or radiological appearance of usual interstitial pneumonia [2]. The definition of IPF
requires the exclusion of other forms of interstitial pneumonia including other idiopathic
interstitial pneumonias and interstitial lung diseases associated with environmental exposure,
medication or systemic disease. IPF predominantly presents in individuals older than 50 years
[2,3] with a preponderance in men and previous or current smokers. Patients present with
chronic exertional dyspnoea, bibasilar inspiratory crackles, and commonly with cough, and
finger clubbing.
IPF is characterised by progressive worsening of dyspnoea and lung function. This chronic
disease is associated with a poor prognosis [2,4]. The median survival of patients diagnosed with
this condition is estimated between 3 and 5 years [5]. The natural disease course is variable and
characterised by various acute events, of whom idiopathic acute exacerbations are a major concern [6,7]. Currently there are no markers to reliably predict the clinical course in an individual
patient. Little is known about the incidence and outcomes after acute events in Europe. While
studies with small samples have focused on the poor prognosis of patients with severe IPF
admitted to intensive care units in Europe and in the United States (US) [8–12], only one recent
single-centre US study has evaluated the reasons for hospital admission and the outcomes for
patients with IPF [13]. The results showed that hospitalisations, especially those related to respiratory problems, were common, and were associated with high in-hospital mortality.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive-fibrosing interstitial lung disease of unknown origin that affects 3 million people worldwide and imparts substantial burdens to patients, their families, and the healthcare system. The IPF disease course is highly variable and presents several diagnostic and management-related challenges.
