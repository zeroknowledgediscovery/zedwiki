# Dynamics From Snapshot

Problem statement example: 

> A key challenge here is that while ecological theory emphasizes dynamic changes in populations through time 10,35,53,56,67,86,103 , most ecological data are limited to snapshots of ecosystems at one or a few time points. This makes linkages to ecological theory difficult. Can we infer dynamics from such snapshots? 

In general this is impossible. However for specifc systems and context we might be able to say something about the dynamics from snapshots separated in time. "Few Shot learning".

## Assumption on the Sysetm of Interest

+ "more or less" rule-closed. Implying there is a set of rules that dicate how teh system operates. This doe snot need to be constant, but are subject to standarad learning regularities
+ A Taken-like result might be possible if we have a system of "many" variables, which co-evolve
+ There exists a distance metric between occurrence states that can chrarectrize the tangent plane at specific observation points.
