# Risk Factors for COVID

COVID-19 can affect anyone, and the disease can cause symptoms ranging from mild to very severe.  For some other illnesses caused by respiratory viruses (such as influenza), some people may be more likely to have severe illness than others because they have characteristics or medical conditions that increase their risk. These are commonly called “risk factors.”  Examples include older age or having certain underlying medical conditions.

CDC is conducting disease surveillance and field investigations to better understand why some people are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 illness. This is one of the top priorities in CDC’s strategy to combat COVID-19. What we learn from these efforts will provide vital information to help CDC scientists and other public health officials make decisions to protect our most vulnerable populations.

# Risk for Severe Illness Increases with Age

As you get older, your risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases. For example, people in their 50s are at higher risk for severe illness than people in their 40s. Similarly, people in their 60s or 70s are, in general, at higher risk for severe illness than people in their 50s. The greatest risk for severe illness from COVID-19 is among those aged 85 or older.

However, this does not mean that the odds of contracting COVID, or that of transmitting COVID increases with age. Implying that populations with older people might not have higher number of infected  people. But since testing was limited at teh begining, it could be that people with more severe symtoms were more likely to be diagnosed, implying a population with higher number of older people might seem to have higher rates of teh disease.
