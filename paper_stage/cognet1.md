# Reverse-engineering Societal Fracture

** Role of economic hardship in fomenting ideological divide in US society**


## Abstract

We report the development of a novel computational framework to uncover, represent and leverage hidden dependecies between opinions on contentious social topics, to ultimately craft a predictive theory of how opinions shift and mature in social groups. Using data from the General Social Survey that curates responses from approximately 40,000 US participants over 4 decades, we show that the ideological divide between the liberal and conservative thought-centers are modulated by economic variables, indicating the possibility of a causal influence from a faltering economy to worsening social polarization. Our data-driven framework, powered by novel learning algorithms, also quantifies the dependencies between key "hot-button topics", and induce a computable yet intrinsically meaningful metric to compare and contrast world-views at the level of individuals, groups, and communities across the societal hierarchy. Understanding how opinions shift, and coalesce is  key to informing  effective domestic policy, and opens the dorr to new research direction in social theory.

# Central Narrative
Gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of a nation's finished domestic goods and services during a specific time period. A related but different metric, the gross national product (GNP), is the value of all finished goods and services owned by a country's residents over a period of time.

GNP "explains" Polar distance over time. Note that GDPcap, GNI are also good predictors, but GNP is the best predictor that produces low enough llk and statistically significant coefficients. Most importantly this underlines the observation that as economic condition improves, the ideological divide between opinion poles falls. Relates economic condition to ideological opinions

We also find that users who try to bridge the echo chambers, by sharing content with diverse leaning, have to pay a »price of bipartisanship» in terms of their network centrality and content appreciation. In addition, we study the role of »gatekeepers,» users who consume content with diverse leaning but produce partisan content (with a single-sided leaning), in the formation of echo chambers. Finally, we apply these findings to the task of predicting partisans and gatekeepers from social and content features. While partisan users turn out relatively easy to identify, gatekeepers prove to be more challenging.

The rise of social media and online social networks has been a
disruptive force in society. Opinions are increasingly shaped by
interactions on online social media, and social phenomena including
disagreement and polarization are now tightly woven into everyday
life. In this work we initiate the study of the following question:
Given n agents, each with its own initial opinion that reflects its core value on a topic, and an
opinion dynamics model, what is the structure
of a social network that minimizes disagreement
and controversy simultaneously?
This question is central to recommender systems: should a recommender system prefer a link suggestion between two online
users with similar mindsets in order to keep disagreement low, or
between two users with different opinions in order to expose each
to the others viewpoint of the world, and decrease overall levels of
polarization and controversy? Such decisions have an important
global effect on society [48].
