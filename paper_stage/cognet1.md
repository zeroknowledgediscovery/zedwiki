# Reverse-engineering Societal Fracture

** Role of economic hardship in fomenting ideological divide in US society**


## Abstract

We report the development of a novel computational framework to uncover, represent and leverage hidden dependecies between opinions on contentious social topics, to ultimately craft a predictive theory of how opinions shift and mature in social groups. Using data from the General Social Survey that curates responses from approximately 40,000 US participants over 4 decades, we show that the ideological divide between the liberal and conservative thought-centers are modulated by economic variables, indicating the possibility of a causal influence from a faltering economy to worsening social polarization. Our data-driven framework, powered by novel learning algorithms, also quantifies the dependencies between key "hot-button topics", and induce a computable yet intrinsically meaningful metric to compare and contrast world-views at the level of individuals, groups, and communities across the societal hierarchy. Understanding how opinions shift, and coalesce is  key to informing  effective domestic policy, and opens the dorr to new research direction in social theory.

# Central Narrative
Gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of a nation's finished domestic goods and services during a specific time period. A related but different metric, the gross national product (GNP), is the value of all finished goods and services owned by a country's residents over a period of time.

GNP "explains" Polar distance over time. Note that GDPcap, GNI are also good predictors, but GNP is the best predictor that produces low enough llk and statistically significant coefficients. Most importantly this underlines the observation that as economic condition improves, the ideological divide between opinion poles falls. Relates economic condition to ideological opinions
