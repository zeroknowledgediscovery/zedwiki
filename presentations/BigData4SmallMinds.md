+ Tycho Brahe was in essensce the first dat ascientist. Collected precise astronomical observations, with instruments he himself developed (teh sextant), and amassed data that enabled Keplar to come up with his laws of planetary motion.
+ Johannes Kepler is best known for his three laws of planetary motion. These laws are: Planets move in orbits shaped like an ellipse. A line between a planet and the Sun covers equal areas in equal times.

## defn of data

+ When we reference data today, we are speaking about very shallow, very specific, and very unambiguous observations.  Consider a buoy out at sea.  One data point from the buoy will tell you the sea temperature, elevation, and direction of the ocean current at a very specific GPS location at 2:05:05 PM on June 22nd, 2015. In fact, the information is so shallow, that we need to take these data points and combine them with many others to get a bigger picture.  This is precisely why the word data is almost always encountered in the plural.  It could be said that a datum is only valuable when it is combined into data (it’s about as valuable as a single pant that’s not joined into pants).
+ data is shallow, mechanically-gathered, systematic information that is recorded in an inanimate device.
+ we can add another constraint: data is self-consciously gathered – it does not result from another activity. Noe tthat this does not always apply, for example EHR data.  In ancient Rome they had tabularia – storehouses of receipts from individual purchases that gave the Romans vision into the state of commerce within the city.

Johann Gregor Mendel (1822–1884) was a lifelong learner, teacher, scientist, and man of faith. As a young adult, he joined the Augustinian Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno in what is now the Czech Republic. Supported by the monastery, he taught physics, botany, and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels. In 1856, he began a decade-long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants, ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary model system (a system with convenient characteristics that is used to study a specific biological phenomenon to gain understanding to be applied to other systems). In 1865, Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the local natural history society. He demonstrated that traits are transmitted faithfully from parents to offspring in specific patterns. In 1866, he published his work, Experiments in Plant Hybridization,1 in the proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn.

Mendel’s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community, which incorrectly believed that the process of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring. This hypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation. Continuous variation is the range of small differences we see among individuals in a characteristic like human height. It does appear that offspring are a “blend” of their parents’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation. Mendel worked instead with traits that show discontinuous variation. Discontinuous variation is the variation seen among individuals when each individual shows one of two—or a very few—easily distinguishable traits, such as violet or white flowers. Mendel’s choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring as would have been expected at the time, but that they were inherited as distinct traits. In 1868, Mendel became abbot of the monastery and exchanged his scientific pursuits for his pastoral duties. He was not recognized for his extraordinary scientific contributions during his lifetime; in fact, it was not until 1900 that his work was rediscovered, reproduced, and revitalized by scientists on the brink of discovering the chromosomal basis of heredity.
