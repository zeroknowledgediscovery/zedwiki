# Comparing baseline screening vs ZCoR screening fro IPF

We look for two or more top IPF comorbidities to identify a high risk population. The prevalence of IPF is such patients in our databse is about 9%.
So if one were to pre-screen for IPF using only comorbidities, then
one would get a screen failure of about 90%.
But studies get screen failure of about 50%, mainly because they are looking for not just IPF persence but also other criteria, and often starting with patients with "definitive IPF diagnosis".

The screening requirent for studies varies. Here we demonstrate performance boost we would get if we were to begin with a high risk patient pool which has the following characteristics:

+ 10% of the population  has IPF, so baseline screen failure rate is > 90%

We show that our post-filtering screen failure rate is well under 40%, i.e., our filtering will slash the screen failure rate by half.
