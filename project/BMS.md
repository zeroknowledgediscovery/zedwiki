# Comparing baseline screening vs ZCoR screening fro IPF

We look for two or more top IPF comorbidities to identify a high risk population. The prevalence of IPF is such patients in our databse is about 9%.
So if one were to pre-screen for IPF using only comorbidities, then
one would get a screen failure of about 90%/

But studies get screen failure of about 50%, mainly because they are looking for not just IPF persence but also othercriteria, and strating with patients with "definitive IPF diagnosis".

The screening requirent for studies varies based on specific requirements, but here we show what kind of performance boost we would get if we were to have a strating population with:

+ 10% of the high risk population has IPF
+ so baseline failure rate is ~90%
+ we show that our post-filtering screen failure rate will be ~
