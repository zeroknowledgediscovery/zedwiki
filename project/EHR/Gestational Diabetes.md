# Exclusion Criteria

1. All patients must have the ICD9 code for the observation of pregnancy (`V22.0, V22.1`)
2. All patients must have EHR records for 52 weeks ( + 12 weeks (~4 months) to account for various time offsets used in the paper) before the first V22 code recorded.
3. Patients are separated into two cohorts: Positive, and Negative.
4. Positive patients are determined by having any of the target codes (recorded in `PUBLISHER/phenotypes/TARGET.dat`) within 32 weeks after the first V22 code recorded.
5. Negative patients are determined by not having any of the target codes. To ascertain the negativity, Negative patients must have target_code-free EHR records available for 32 weeks after the first V22 code recorded.

## Unspecified disorder of plasma protein metabolism (273.9)

Maternal plasma cfDNA levels and pregnancy outcomes were obtained from non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) Screening System and hospitalization records, respectively~\cite{pmid31278894} in a Chinese population of 831 women, and increase in cell free DNA levels were associated with increased risk of GDM, and was dependent on maternal age, which was posited to be an important effect modifier. Evidence also exists that improper metabolism of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) might be implicated inincreased risk of GDM~\cite{pmid27511926}, by inceasing plasma concentrations of ferritin. In addition, associations with reduction in levels of maternal pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) has been shown to be a predictor of GDM, type 2 diabetes (T2D), or large-for-gestational-age (LGA) births~\cite{pmid842585}.
 
 
## Other specified disorders of adrenal glands (255.8) Other corticoadrenal overactivity (255.3)
Cushing's disease caused by an adrenal adenoma is rare during pregnancy and may be overlooked by obstetricians and physicians, but can lead to hypertension, diabetes mellitus and an increased risk of fetal and maternal morbidity~\cite{pmid30943935,pmid27704478}. Some rare tumors of the adrenal gland have also been reported to mimic gestational hypertension, preeclampsia or eclampsia, and gestational diabetes mellitus~\cite{pmid23527821}. 

## Vitamin B6

There is some evidence of vitamin B6 deficiency implicated in GDM~\cite{pmid842585,sukumar2016prevalence}. The increased association between depression and diabetes mellitus is generally acknowledged. Recent studies suggest that depression leads to diabetes. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for this association remain unclear. Literature and our data indicate that inflammatory and/or stress factors in depression up-regulate tryptophan (TRP) conversion into kynurenine (KYN), a substrate for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis. Deficiency of vitamin B6, a cofactor of the key enzymes of KYN - NAD pathway, shunts KYN metabolism from formation of NAD towards production of xanthurenic (XA) and kynurenic (KYNA) acids. Human and experimental studies reveal that XA, KYNA and their metabolites interfere with production, release and biological activity of insulin~\cite{pmid25401165}.
