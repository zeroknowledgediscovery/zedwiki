# Infant Microbiome Modeling 
+   We have a set of `control variables` namely connected to the mode of feeding (3 modes)
+   We have a set of `internal state` observations in the form of bacterial colonization profiles
+   We have one or more `outcome measures` such as head circumeference measurement as a proxy of cognitive development
+   All these measurements have tagged timestamps

## Aim one: Reverse-engineering the Wiring between control to state to oucome

## Aim two: How Does Perturbations in Internal States or Control Variables Affect the Rest of the Parameters

## How do we incorporate time in the analysis

## Can we carry out modeling at the highest entity resolution?

# Relative Biome Dynamics

...the postnatal very preterm gut is colonised in a structured sequence by facultative anaerobes followed by obligate anaerobes. The initial class is Bacilli followed by a bloom of Gammaproteobacteria and finally an increase in Clostridia. There is a paucity of Lactobacillus,Bifidobacillus and the phyla Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. 
+ The final pattern is well established by 30 to 36 weeks corrected age. 
+ At phylum level, Firmicutes dominates at 1 week and Proteobacteria at 1 month. 
+ The prevalence of Firmicutes at 1 week is 0.65 decreasing to 0.32 by 1 month while Proteobacteria increases from 0.28 to 0.66 over the same period. 
+ The Shannon diversity index ranges from 0.38 to 1.4 at 1 week, increases by 2 weeks and reaches 0.71 to 0.9 by 1 month.

Microbial dysbiosis preceding NEC in preterm infants is characterized by increased relative abundances of Proteobacteria and decreased relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Microbiome optimization may provide a novel strategy for preventing NEC.
