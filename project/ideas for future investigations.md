# AD vs Depression

Late life depression confers 4-6x higher risk of cognitive dysfunction and decline to Alzheimerâ€™s disease than in non-depressed older adults. However, depression is also a modifiable risk factor, thereby offering opportunities for reducing AD burden
through interventions for late life depression.

# Longitudinal Brain Network Analysis

Deeply-phenotyped, longitudinal datasets: OASIS-3 and ADNI-Depression Project. OASIS-3 will enable identifying functional brain changes distinguishing the trajectories of late-life depression from AD, or their comorbid occurrence.

# AD Biomarker Modeling

ADNI database
