## AD vs Depression

Late life depression confers 4-6x higher risk of cognitive dysfunction and decline to Alzheimerâ€™s disease than in non-depressed older adults. However, depression is also a modifiable risk factor, thereby offering opportunities for reducing AD burden through interventions for late life depression.

## Longitudinal Brain Network Analysis

Deeply-phenotyped, longitudinal datasets: OASIS-3 and ADNI-Depression Project. OASIS-3 will enable identifying functional brain changes distinguishing the trajectories of late-life depression from AD, or their comorbid occurrence.
OASIS-3 and ADNI-Depression projects. These data can be used to identify how changes over time in specific brain networks interact with specific outcomes (maybe depression) to predict cognitive decline. 

+ identify resting state networks whose changes over time differs between depressed and non-depressed older adults, and then identify network changes that interact with depression to predict cognitive decline over time (OASIS-3)


## AD Biomarker Modeling

ADNI database

## AD Measures

We propose to use CDR as the primary outcome measure in our
models. However, other outcome measures could be additionally informative. Thus, we will also explore
models with cognitive outcome variables that have a greater range of scores (e.g., MMSE or cross-domain
cognitive composite scores), and probe single domains of cognition (e.g., episodic memory, executive function).
For Aim 3, comparing the ADNI-D sample to the original ADNI (i.e., non-depressed) sample would further
increase sample size and permit analyses across a full range of non-depressed up to MDD.
