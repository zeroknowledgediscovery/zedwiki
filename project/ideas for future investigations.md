## AD vs Depression

Late life depression confers 4-6x higher risk of cognitive dysfunction and decline to Alzheimerâ€™s disease than in non-depressed older adults. However, depression is also a modifiable risk factor, thereby offering opportunities for reducing AD burden through interventions for late life depression.

## Longitudinal Brain Network Analysis

Deeply-phenotyped, longitudinal datasets: OASIS-3 and ADNI-Depression Project. OASIS-3 will enable identifying functional brain changes distinguishing the trajectories of late-life depression from AD, or their comorbid occurrence.
OASIS-3 and ADNI-Depression projects. These data can be used to identify how changes over time in specific brain networks interact with specific outcomes (maybe depression) to predict cognitive decline. 

+ identify resting state networks whose changes over time differs between depressed and non-depressed older adults, and then identify network changes that interact with depression to predict cognitive decline over time (OASIS-3)
